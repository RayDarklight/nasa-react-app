            <p> **Ancient Delta in Jezero Crater**:</p>
            <p> - One of the most detailed views of the Martian landscape was captured by NASA's Perseverance rover. This panorama was taken in an ancient delta within the Jezero Crater.</p>
            <p> - The delta was formed around 3.5 billion years ago when a river flowed into Lake Jezero, depositing mud and sand on the crater floor.</p>
            <p> - Perseverance's Mastcam-Z camera system snapped over 1,000 individual images in mid-July, which were stitched together to create a stunning 2.5-billion-pixel mosaic.</p>
            <p> - In this image, you can see the rover's tracks on the left side, where it rolled into the crater. A rocky 32-foot (10-meter) cliff stands directly in front of the rover—a testament to the enduring Martian winds that shaped these ancient rocks¹.</p>
